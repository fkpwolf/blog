test code  
`if (component instanceof ValueHolder && (null != (converter = ((ValueHolder)` 

the css please refers [here][1]. make sure that css code block should be placed in <head> and started with .post.

&nbsp; In your blog, you should enbrace your code with <code> tag in HTML view.&nbsp; And in your code block, you cann&#8217;t use <> these simble. You change it into HTML code by some tools like [phpfi][2]. It also provides highlighting feature.

&nbsp; But this approach is some boring. Later I found M$ Live [Writer][3]. It is cool. You can edit blog on offline mode and post it when online. You also can download blog item, modify it, and update it to Blogger. You also can delete blog&nbsp;by Writer although Writer didn&#8217;t&nbsp;remind you. The editor is css-enable. And more interesting&nbsp;it is extensible.

&nbsp; It&#8217;s disadvantage I found until now is that it cann&#8217;t upload image file(Blogger does not support it). It can just add a image link.

&nbsp; (6.4 add)Today Writer beta2 is released. It has many nice feature. The biggest imprement is that my article can&nbsp;use tag. Well Done! It looks really cool! I think Microsoft will let it more powerful.

&nbsp; The reason of Writer&#8217;s existen is:1)It provide offline edit mode; 2)It is WYEIWYS editor; 3) web editor is not so much convenient until now. You will find these problem specially when the article is some long.
