1) Install Cairo for Mac. You can install it by <a href="http://cairo.darwinports.com/" target="_blank">darwinports</a>. You should change the Portfile to enable cairo for configuration. The file located at /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/ports/graphics/cairo on my machine. Maybe there is another better way to do it, for example <a href="http://guide.macports.org/chunked/development.variants.html" target="_blank">Port Variants</a>.

2) check out the cairo demo code.  
`cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.cairographics.org:/cvs/cairo co cairo-demo<br />
`  
3) Then there is a project named QuartzCaiorTest. Change the main.c to  
use the new API

<pre class="brush: c">//surface = cairo_quartz_surface_create(context, width, height);
surface =Â  cairo_quartz_surface_create_for_cg_context(context, width, height);</pre>

4) run &#8220;make&#8221; within project directory.

The counterpart of Google on vector graphic library is Skia. It is also can built on Mac OS:https://skia.org/user/quick/macos.
