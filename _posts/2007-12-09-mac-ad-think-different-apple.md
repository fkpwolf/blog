Here&#8217;s to the crazy ones.  
The misfits.  
The rebels.  
The troublemakers.  
The round pegs in the square holes.  
The ones who see things differently.  
They&#8217;re not fond of rules  
And they have no respect for the status quo.  
You can praise them, quote them, disagree with them  
disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them.  
About the only thing that you can&#8217;t do is ignore them.  
Because they change things.  
<span style="font-style: italic;"> They invent. They imagine. They heal.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;"> They explore. They create. They inspire.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;"> They push the human race forward.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;"> Maybe they have to be crazy.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;"> How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;"> Or sit in silence and hear a song that&#8217;s never been written?</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;"> Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?</span>  
We make tools for these kinds of people.  
While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.  
Because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can  
change the world, are the ones who do.
