**&nbsp; Data Table **is heavily used in information system. In most case, these tables just display a query result set. They are read only. The operations on them are: paging, sorting, single selection and multi-selection. The all elements of a table include: field, field title, sort and page number state, and value format(or convert). In some extend, a data table is not too much associated with other page elements. So it will be a better way to define a table in **one** place other than **several** places in application.
